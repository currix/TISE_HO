Fortran programs for solving the 1D TISE for a potential of the form

a X^4 + b X^2 + c X

using a HO basis.

by Currix TM

Allows performance benchmarking, search for convergence in eigenvalues, and
computes:

Eigenvalues
Eigenstates
Participation Ratio
Husimi Participation Ratio
Expected values of <n>, <X>, and <X^2>
Space dependence of Eigenstates psi(X)

Requirements: LAPACK95 and intlib

Install

From the src directory:

$ make all

Programs

quartic_HO_energies_gfortran
quartic_HO_energies_openmp_gfortran (multiprocessor version)

If ifort is installed the program can be compiled as

$ make -f Makefile_ifort all

and the programs will be

quartic_HO_energies_ifort
quartic_HO_energies_openmp_ifort (multiprocessor version)


The program user's guide will be found in the doc directory in pdf,
html, and txt formats.
